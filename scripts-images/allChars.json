Stern and focused, she would remark upon the more outrageous tactics carried out by Anakin Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi in the course of the war, but would rarely condemn their effective actions. Though not as brash as Anakin, Adi Gallia was known to be an aggressive warrior who had no problem bringing the fight to the enemy.",

    "description": "An ambitious Imperial officer, Piett rose through the ranks to captain and was assigned to the Super Star Destroyer Executor, Darth Vader's flagship. There, he chafed at having to serve under the foolish, vainglorious Admiral Ozzel. When Vader strangled Ozzel, Piett was granted a battlefield promotion to admiral -- and given a grisly warning of the penalty for failure. Miraculously, he survived his time as Vader's underling, but died when a Rebel starfighter destroyed the Executor's command bridge.",

Kolar displayed his renowned skill with a lightsaber during the battle in the Geonosian arena, though his young Padawan died during the fighting. In the final days of the Clone Wars, Windu turned to Kolar again, calling on him, Saesee Tiin and Kit Fisto to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Confronted by the Jedi, Palpatine threw off his guise and revealed himself as Darth Sidious. He ignited his crimson-bladed lightsaber and struck down Kolar.",

As a member of Chancellor Palpatine’s inner-circle, he was privy to many of the meetings and decisions that allowed the Republic to take military action against the secessionists threatening to leave the Republic. He was a strong proponent of this action, but allowed Representative Binks to advance the military creation act.",

Rumors persist that he occasionally functions as hired protection for criminal families, and he is confirmed to be a self-sufficient bounty hunter. Highsinger's servomotors and manipulators are precision-engineered to offer unparalleled reflexes that give the large droid the skills of a martial artist. By unlocking a rotator assembly in his trunk, Highsinger can become a rapid-firing, spinning turret of destruction with terrifying accuracy.",

During the Clone Wars, she was involved in a plot with Cad Bane to steal a holocron from the Jedi Temple. Using holographic technology in addition to her shape changing abilities, she was able to infiltrate the Jedi Temple disguised as Ord Eniscence, a Jedi master murdered by Cad Bane. Eventually, Parasitti had to abandon that identity and assume the guise of Jedi Librarian Jocasta Nu. Eventually, padawan Ahsoka Tano saw through her disguise and defeated the Clawdite.",

    "description": "As the chairman of the Pantoran Assembly, Chi Cho, was an arrogant and ruthless leader who had no interest in seeking peaceful solutions to his problems. Hoping to use the Jedi as an instrument of blunt force to take back the planet of Orto Plutonia back for the Pantorans, Cho and the Jedi accompanying him (including Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker) find nothing more than a deserted Separatist base. When it was discovered that a primitive group of Talz had claimed the moon for themselves, Cho almost single-handedly declares war against them and charges into an ill-conceived battle. He met his death at the end of a Talz’ spear.",

    "description": "Clone Commander Gree, designation 1004, led the Elite Corps of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. He saw deployments on such heated battlefronts as Kashyyyk. Gree himself wore camouflaged armor to better blend into jungle surroundings. Though a faithful commander who carried out the Jedi's orders, Gree was ultimately loyal to the Republic. When Chancellor Palpatine enacted Order 66, Gree understood it was a worst-case scenario contingency -- the Jedi had betrayed the Republic, and were therefore dangerous enemies of the state.",

    "description": "Though the clone troopers embodied the war effort of the Galactic Republic against the Separatist Alliance, victory was reliant upon valiant patriots of all shapes and sizes. Meebur Gascon answered the call of duty at the very start of the conflict, and offered his keen analysis as part of Strategic Command since the Battle of Geonosis. The Jedi Council placed Gascon in command of D-Squad's mission to obtain a vital Separatist encryption module. No-nonsense and military-minded with an outsized personality and gruff voice, the diminutive Gascon balked at any suggestion that he was simply a map reader, or that his D-Squad assignment was a result of his tiny size.",

Greedy, deceitful and cowardly, Dofine nevertheless had the wherewithal to openly question Darth Sidious' machinations, for which he was verbally reprimanded by the Sith Lord. Despite his insubordination, Dofine remained in command of the blockade's forces. He gave the order to activate the droids on the surface of Naboo. Dofine perished aboard the Droid Control Ship when Naboo starfighter forces destroyed the vessel.",

    "description": "It's easy to misjudge the deadliness of a gasbag. Derrown was a Parwan bounty hunter, an alien species with a lighter-than-air physiology that allowed him to float about on air currents, anchoring himself with four leg-like tentacles and two arms. His buoyancy let him reach heights and vantage points not easily accessible to standard density competitors, but he lacked the speed and control that came with mass. The Parwan biology produces intense electrical fields -- Derrown literally crackled with energy, earning him the grisly moniker the Exterminator. To prevent any ill-effects with his carried explosives, he kept them safe in an insulated bandolier across his shoulders.",

A freelance hunter, Embo worked with the likes of Sugi and Boba Fett, loyal only to his faithful anooba, Marrok.",

When the planet sided with the Separatists during the Clone Wars, Tandin supported the new king, Sanjay Rash, despite his misgivings of offworld interlopers interfering in Onderonian affairs. The people of Onderon, though, began to reject Rash's rule, and an insurgency began targeting the battle droid forces stationed on the planet. Tandin had difficulty waging war against his own people, and cared little for the military support and tactical advice offered by the emotionless droids sent by the Confederacy to reinforce his defenses.",

    "description": "Gha Nachkt was an out-of-shape Trandoshan male who operated as a salvage ship captain during the Clone Wars era. He was hovering around the Bothawui in his salvage freighter Vulture’s Claw when a battle between the Republic and Separatist Alliance occurred, which allowed him to capture Artoo-Detoo. During that battle, some of the debris he picked up included the remains of Anakin Skywalker’s Jedi Starfighter and his droid, R2-D2. Knowing the astromech droid would be full of useful intelligence for the Separatists, he arranged to sell the droid to General Grievous. After performing an autopsy on the droid and finding far more secret Republic information than he expected, he tried extorting the droid general for more money.",

He was found and rehabilitated by Mr. Borkus, and unscrupulous diner owner from the dusty town of Pons Ora. When the Republic agents of D-Squad discovered Gregor, they rekindled his memories of duty, service, and honor, and the commando reclaimed his armor and fought to a spectacular finish to ensure D-Squad carried out its crucial mission.",

Like many Wookiees, Gungi was temperamental and expressive -- and controlling his patience proved to be a real challenge. When Gungi was a Jedi youngling during the time of the Clone Wars, he needed to learn to slow down his impulsive ways in order to pass the ancient rite of passage ritual known as The Gathering.",

The burly rebel pilot flew an X-wing at the Battle of Yavin under the call sign Red 6. His X-wing developed a mechanical problem early in the battle, leaving him struggling to maneuver. Before Porkins or his astromech could fix the problem, one of the Death Star’s turbolasers zeroed in on the X-wing, incinerating it and killing Porkins instantly.",

While not having been a very politically impactful planet, it's hub of gambling and smuggling offered Kessen the unique opportunity of creating a vast network of contacts and influence throughout the galaxy's seedy underground. Known to be quite over confident and even a bit of a chauvinist in his dealings with his associates, Johhar is often preoccupied with big game hunting. He owns a rifle that he's named \"Karina.\"",

To keep his past a secret, Kanan carried a blaster -- an uncommon practice for a Jedi -- and used a lightsaber that had to be assembled. He was a leader among the Ghost crew, a small group of rebels looking to strike back against the Empire, and with the emergence of the Force-sensitive Ezra, once again embraced his identity as a Jedi Knight.",

    "description": "To hear Lott Dod tell it, the actions of Nute Gunray did not reflect the true intents of the Trade Federation, which remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. Sure, the Separatist Alliance did use Trade Federation starships and battle droids as part of their fighting forces in the Clone Wars, but this was equipment legitimately purchased in the open market. The Trade Federation was committed to commerce across the entire galaxy, and had no interest in getting caught up in territorial wars, Dodd would say. In truth, the Senator received a healthy income to ensure both sides of the war stay well equipped.",

    "description": "The son of Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri, Lux was young, idealistic, and skeptical of the aims of the Republic and the Jedi Knights. His father was a fervent supporter of the Separatists, and was killed by clone troopers on Aargonar. Lux did not know what to make of Ahsoka Tano and her visit to Separatist space. After a failed peace overture begun by Mina extended to the Republic, Lux’s mother died, assassinated on Count Dooku’s orders. After making an ill-fated effort to avenge her by killing Dooku, Lux joined the anti-Separatist resistance on his homeworld of Onderon. After the rebels defeated the Separatists, Lux became Onderon’s Republic Senator.",

    "description": "A heavyset, barrel-chested Sullustan, Mister Borkus is the proprietor of a no-frills diner in Pons Ora, a small settlement on the mostly unknown world of Abafar. The opportunistic Borkus stumbled upon a clone commando suffering from amnesia. The soldier had escaped a devastating battle, and was stripped of his memory and his identity. Borkus callously took the clone -- Gregor -- under his care, never revealing his origin to the grateful survivor. Borkus \"generously\" offered to give Gregor room and board, at an expense, and also employed him as a dishwasher. But Gregor's meager wage wasn't enough to pay for his necessities, and thus the lowly dishwasher was little more than Borkus's slave.",

    "description": "Neimoidians are known for their business skills, but Nute Gunray, Viceroy of the Trade Federation, was more cutthroat than most. It was Gunray who conspired with the Sith Lord Darth Sidious to launch the blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo. Once the planet was under siege, Gunray attempted to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty that would legitimize the occupation. Amidala escaped, and returned to infiltrate her own palace and blast through Gunray's protectors. Arrested by Republic officials, Gunray was carted off to answer for his crimes, but evaded imprisonment and kept his post.",

With a network of contacts spread throughout the walled city of Iziz, Okalin was able to stay abreast of the shifting tides of fears and sympathy that gripped the Onderonian citizens during the Clone Wars. Okalin warned King Sanjay Rash of terrorist strikes that threatened his life, but the even-tempered advisor was careful not to provoke the ire of the king or his war leaders.",

    "description": "On a lawless world like Nal Hutta, every corner store might be the source of lethal munitions and untraceable weaponry. Pablo's pawnshop proudly boasted all sorts of deadly gear. Based out of the Bilbousa Bazaar, Pablo kept a well-stocked shop reputed to have everything a bounty hunter might need. The shifty Rodian spoke in a sycophantic whisper, always careful not to upset his potentially murderous clientele. His connection to the Hutts and his ability to keep his store well-stocked is what kept the slimy trader alive and intact. If threatened, the spineless Rodian always backed down, much to the consternation of his Twi'lek partner, who worried for his safety.",

    "description": "As Prime Minister of Mandalore during the Clone Wars, Almec claimed loyalty to Duchess Satine Kryze and her controversial campaign of neutrality and pacifism. Almec saw Mandalore's violent past as shameful, and feared that the return of the armored warriors of Death Watch would be unstoppable. Though Almec loudly said that he valued the sanctity of Mandalorians above all else, his politician's grin and careful words concealed a different agenda. He helped establish a profitable black-market network that brought goods to Mandalore, looking the other way when tainted goods caused the deaths of Mandalorian children. When his smugglers’ ties were discovered, Almec tried to overthrow Satine, only to wind up in prison himself. He was freed by Darth Maul, who installed him as a puppet leader of the planet.",

He enjoyed his work, and was eager to experiment in speed, agility, and weaponry, though he was no pilot himself. During the early days of the rebellion, Quarrie gifted his B-wing to Hera and Phoenix Squadron, helping turn the tide in one key battle and giving the fleet some much-needed firepower.",

    "description": "The queen of the neutral planet Bardotta, Julia appealed to the Republic for assistance after her world’s Dagoyan Masters began disappearing. To the Republic’s confusion, Julia asked specifically for assistance from Jar Jar Binks instead of a Senate delegation or Jedi Knights. Jar Jar answered the call of his beloved, but Mace Windu came with him – to Julia’s displeasure. The Gungan and the Jedi discovered the Frangrawl clan was kidnapping the Dagoyan Masters, but the cultists took Julia to Zardossa Stix to be sacrificed in a Force-draining ceremony. Jar Jar and Mace arrived just in time to rescue the Bardottan monarch.",

    "description": "A venerable if maverick Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn was a student of the living Force. Qui-Gon lived for the moment, espousing a philosophy of \"feel, don't think -- use your instincts.\" On Tatooine, Qui-Gon discovered a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who was strong in the Force. Sensing the boy's potential, Qui-Gon liberated Anakin from slavery. The Jedi Master presented Anakin to the Jedi Council, but they deemed the boy too old to begin training and dangerously full of fear and anger. They refused to allow Qui-Gon to train Anakin, but rescinded their decision to fulfill Qui-Gon's dying wish.",

Sabé becomes a decoy, disguised as the Queen, while Amidala adopts a simple gown of a handmaiden, and goes by her less formal name of Padmé Naberrie. When in this role, Sabé and Padmé secretly communicate with subtle signals as to not divulge their true identities. During the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo, Sabé posed as the Queen on several occasions.",

Stass led clone troopers into battle on many worlds, culminating with the Outer Rim Sieges. She was piloting her BARC speeder on Saleucami when Darth Sidious issued Order 66 to her wingman, Commander Neyo. Obeying orders, Neyo and another clone trooper dropped behind Stass and blew her speeder bike out of the sky.",
